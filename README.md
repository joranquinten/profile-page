# Profile page

This is an example profile page. Feel free to modify to suit your own needs. For text updates, modify the `data/nl.js` file. Otherwise you'd have to modify the code.

The repo has been built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Styled Components üíÖ](https://www.styled-components.com/) & [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) under the hood.

Testing is done by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [AirBnB's Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for validation snapshots.

The idea is that you can use NextJS to generate a static website, while leveraging JavaScript for repetetive tasks and interactivity.

This repos is completely Open Source in the way that if you fork the code, you are free to do whatever you please with the code, structure and styling.

Enjoy ‚úåÔ∏è
